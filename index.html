    <h3>What is Blue?</h2>
    <p> <strong>Blue</strong> is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model (traditional colour theory), 
        as well as in the RGB (additive) colour model. It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light. 
        The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 
        Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green, while ultramarine contains some violet. 
        The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. 
        An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of 
        another optical effect called aerial perspective.</p>
